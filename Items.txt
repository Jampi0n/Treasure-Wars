Stats and implementation:

Advantage using item abilities: configuration can be local, as item object and effect (ability object) are both created at compiletime
Using triggers, I need to store the configuration for runtime.

calculate relative bonus:
first absolute, then relative

when?
	use a function to change a stat, it will automatically
	change the relative values



hp:
	hero stat: upgrade
	absolute: item ability
	relative: bonus mod
hp-reg:
	remove upgrade, use trigger instead -> prevent hp reg
	absolute & relative: trigger
	
mana & mana-reg same as hp & hp-reg

armor:
	hero stat: upgrade
	absolute: item ability
