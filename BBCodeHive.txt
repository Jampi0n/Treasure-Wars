Treasure Wars is a 10 player [abbr=Multiplayer online battle arena]MOBA[/abbr] map. Two teams of up to 5 players fight against each other, trying to destroy the enemy castle first.

[SIZE=5]Custom Stat System[/SIZE]
Each hero has 10 stats that increase individually, when the hero levels up and can be boosted by items and abilities.
[LIST]
[*]Strength: increases attack damage and the power of some abilities
[*]Willpower: reduces incoming magic damage and reduces the duration of most negative buffs
[*]Intelligence: increases the power of some abilities
[*]Armor: reduces incmoing physical damage
[*]Attack Speed
[*]Hit Points
[*]Hit Point Regeneration
[*]Mana Points
[*]Mana Point Regeneration
[/LIST]
[SIZE=5]Ability Scaling[/SIZE]
Most abilities scale with either Strength or Intelligence, allowing all heroes to become more powerful over time. This is not limited to damage, but can also increase the duration of a stun, affect how much you slow the enemy or increase the amount of bonus armor your spell gives.

[SIZE=5]Utilize your Base[/SIZE]
Send additional troops to gain help you siege the enemy, use teleporters to quickly move over the map or research upgrades to gain a big advantage in the long run.

[SIZE=5]Strategical Siege[/SIZE]
At the same time this means that taking down the enemy's infrastructure can give you a strategical advantage. Destroying the workshop for example will greatly reduce the enemy's damage output against buildings.

[SIZE=5]Fight for the Hydras[/SIZE]
Killing a Hydra gives your team an advantage for the rest of the game, but fighting against a hydra is a dangerous endeavor, as the enemy team can use this opportunity to win a team fight.

[SIZE=5]Development[/SIZE]

The map is still being developed. At this point most of the basic systems are done, so the current focus is to add new heroes, improve balance and fix bugs.

Feel free to leave feedback and suggestions, as it is vital for me in order to improve the map.
If you come across a bug, please report it in the thread.

The map is written in wurst and the source code can be found on [URL='https://github.com/Jampi0n/wurst.moba']GitHub[/URL].
